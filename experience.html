        <h1>KTU Special</h1>
        <h3>Python Application Developer</h3>
        <p>As a freelance Python Application Developer for KTU Special, 
            I specialized in building robust automation tools using a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach to ensure high reliability and code quality. 
            I engineered a sophisticated document management suite that automated critical branding workflows,
             including high-volume batch watermarking and seamless PDF merging, which significantly reduced manual processing time for the team.
              Beyond PDF manipulation, I developed specialized utility scripts to automate the conversion of PowerPoint presentations into high-fidelity PDF documents, 
              maintaining perfect structural integrity. By combining a user-friendly GUI with a rigorously tested back-end, 
            I delivered scalable solutions that empowered non-technical staff to handle complex batch operations with precision and speed.</p>

        <h3>Full Stack Developer Intern</h3>
        <p>During my internship as a Full Stack Web Developer at Diviso Softtech (Sub division of LXISoft),
             I collaborated with a multidisciplinary team to build the Galaxy Dice Game,
              a multiplayer online gaming platform developed using Java. This project was a significant exercise in team coordination and agile cooperation,
               as we worked together to synchronize front-end user interfaces with complex back-end game logic.
                I focused on ensuring robust data handling and real-time state management, while closely aligning with my peers to identify user requirements 
                and design intuitive features. This experience reinforced the importance of collective problem-solving,
             where regular code reviews and peer feedback allowed us to deliver a scalable, responsive, and interactive gaming experience</p>

        <h1>Assistrend</h1>
        <h3>Social Media Content Creator</h3>
        <p>During my time at Assistrend, I worked on creating informative and emotionally engaging video content for their Instagram page, 
            with a strong focus on simplifying complex topics for a general audience. 
            One of my key projects was an educational short film about an aspiring young girl who becomes fascinated by astronomy after seeing the night sky,
             and a boy who patiently explains the universe to her in a relatable, story-driven way. I handled the complete video pipeline, 
             from refining the narrative concept and planning the shots to editing the footage, adding motion graphics, 
             and syncing visuals with music to maintain viewer attention. The goal of this piece was to inspire curiosity about space in younger audiences while aligning with Assistrend’s brand identity as a modern, knowledge-focused platform. 
             Through careful pacing, clear on-screen text, and smooth transitions, the video was designed to feel both cinematic and informative, 
            making complex astronomical ideas feel accessible and emotionally resonant for Instagram viewers.​</p>
